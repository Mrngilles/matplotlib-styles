# Paper specific styles

In this folder, you will be able to find the styles used to publish in 
different journals. If you ever publish in a journal and use a particular style
to do it, do not hesitate either to send it to me <mrngilles@gmail.com> or to
submit a pull request in [GitHub](github.com/mrngilles/matplotlib-styles). If
possible, try to also provide a document stating the expected requirements for
the journal.
