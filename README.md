# Matplotlib-styles
This repository contains different styles to apply to matplotlib figures.

This is still a very early repo, do not hesitate to contribute and help developing it.

# Ideas
- Use chained stylesheet with
    + Aesthetics stylesheets (colors, fonts, etc...)
    + Layout stylesheets (paper, talks, etc...)
